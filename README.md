Hi, I’m @danieled01 and love to learn new technologies as well as exploring new things all the time. I feel the happiest when I am absorbing and trying out new concepts so every day is a learning day

Currently I am interested in the following:

- IAC
- Terraform
- AWS
- Python
- Bash Scripting
- Ansible
- Docker
- Kubernetes

I’m currently actively learning in depth:

- Docker
- Kubernets

I'm currently studying to pass:

- AWS DevOps Professional Exam

I’m looking to help anyway I can on any of the above.

The best way to reach me is via email - daniele.damico.github@gmail.com
